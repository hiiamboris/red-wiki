## red won't run?

 *  are you running latest version?
	* stable version is old
	* many problems have been fixed since then
	* is it copied to a path that can be found?


* you've downloaded latest from red-lang
	* or
* you've cloned or downloaded source from github.com/red/red 
	*  and Rebol and built the gui console



 *  which OS
	* windows, has your Anti-Virus quarantined?
	
	* linux,  using wine or some virtual machine
		*	installed 32bit libs?
		 	see: red-lang.org download page
		
	* Mac, newer versions require 64 bit so need a virtual solution
		* red is 32 bit at this time
		 	see: unofficial prepared docker/vm

## red still won't run
	*	does red --cli work?
	*	have previous versions worked?
	* run red from a terminal to see any error messages
	* check event log for errors

 * windows 7, 10 64bit or 32 bit,
 * if only the gui console or your compiled programs fail:  run dxdiag
	*	using old computer with limited gpu?
	*  dxdiag version should be 11 or greater to run the gui console.
	*     update drivers or video card, install SP1 from Microsoft.
	*	sorry, you might be stuck running older version pre 2021 or cli only
	*   but you may be able to compile for windows before DirectX D2D as well..

```
	the game of 20 questions is really no fun for anyone.
	* what is your OS?
	* which red did you try to run?
	* have you tried:  red --cli
	* has your AV quarantined the executable?
	* are you able to try another computer?
	* for Mac and linux users, red only works in 32 bit mode.
		* Mac users can run a docker or VM
		* linux users can usually install 32 bit libs
		* 	see: the download page

	* does help work in the REPL console?
	* a different OS or a problem not mentioned above?
