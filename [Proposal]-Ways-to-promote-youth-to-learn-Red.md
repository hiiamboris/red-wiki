_This is a public proposal, everyone is allowed to add suggestion to this_

# Creating a simplified dialect
* "Lego Bricks" Graphical Programming that has the design of Scratch
* Creating a red dialect for absolute programming beginners
    * Think "Learn Red in Minutes" but easier to use
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_educational_programming_languages

# Easy to access online interpreter and learning
* https://repl.it/ like websites
    * Allows terminal/command-line and IDE/text-editor on split screen
    * Syntax-highlighting help kids to identify code and errors
    * Code Assistance and Context Completion makes typing fast
        * Code Assistance provides a list of plausible terms
        * Context Completion uses existing training data sets
    * Spell-checking helps kids with bad spelling skills to code
    * Debuggers to show the exact line of error
* using https://www.codecademy.com/ as an example
    * Allows a 1-to-1 like tutorial
    * Automatically records progress on the cloud or offline
        * Might require a big server to store the data
        * If it is stored in the client, would it expand uncontrollably?
* using https://www.pythontutor.com/ as an example
    * Allows step-by-step analysis on the code with diagram GUIs
* using a simplified versions of the the Git system

# Real-life correspondence
* Collaborate RaspberryPi and it's clones
    * Collaborate with [Pi Top](https://www.pi-top.com/)
    * Put focus on RaspberryPi's official languages
        * Python, Ruby, Perl, Squeak-Smalltalk
        * C, C++, Java, BBC BASIC
* Collaboration with LittleBits and other similar projects
    * [BeagleBone](http://beagleboard.org/)
    * [LittleBits](https://littlebits.cc/)
    * [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

# Creating promotional works and campaigns to pitch Red
* create a cultural distinction between Red and other languages
    * e.g. "Redder and Hotter than Ruby"
* using "Edginess" (want to challenge authority) as selling point
    * e.g. "We are the ProGrammer Nazi"
* using Augmented Reality Games to gain mythical/fictional narrative
    * e.g. ...

# Designing Mascots and Comic/Animation for Red
* naming the characters
