# Creating a simplified dialect
* "Lego Bricks" Graphical Programming that has the design of Scratch
* Creating a red dialect for absolute programming beginners
    * Think "Learn Red in Minutes" but easier to use
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_educational_programming_languages

# Easy to access online interpreter and learning
* http://repl.it/ like websites
    * Allows terminal/command-line and IDE/text-editor on split screen
    * Syntax-highlighting help kids to identify code and errors
    * Code Assistance and Context Completion makes typing fast
        * Code Assistance provides a list of plausible terms
        * Context Completion uses existing training data sets
    * Spell-checking helps kids with bad spelling skills to code
    * Debuggers to show the exact line of error
* using htts://www.codecademy.com/ as an example
    * Allows a 1-to-1 like tutorial, and records progress on the cloud or offline
* using a simplified versions of the the Git system

# Real-life correspondence
* Beaglebone Black or Arduino, or Clones of RaspberryPi
* Collaboration with LittleBits and other similar projects

# Creating promotional works and campaigns to pitch Red
* create a cultural distinction between Red and other languages
    * e.g. "Redder and Hotter than Ruby"
* using "Edginess" (want to challenge authority) as selling point
    * e.g. "We are the ProGrammer Nazi"
* using Augmented Reality Games to gain mythical/fictional narrative
    * e.g. ...
