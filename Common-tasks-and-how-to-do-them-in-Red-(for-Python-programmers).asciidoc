== Files and directories

=== Selecting a directory

`request-dir` displays a dialogue for the user to select a directory. Returns full directory path. You can set the starting directory with `/dir` refinement:

---- 
doc-dir: request-dir/dir %/C/Users/Owner/Documents/
---- 

You can set the title of the dialogue with `/title` refinement and provide a string for its `text` argument.

=== Selecting a file

Similarly, you can use `request-file` to select a file. You can set a default file or directory with `/file` refinement. Provide filters with `/filters`. The argument to this refinement is a block of name (`string!`) and type (`file!` or `string!`) pairs.

---- 
>> request-file/file/filter %"/C/Red-lang/Rededitor-11/examples/" ["red" %*.red]
== %"/C/Red-lang/Rededitor-11/examples/7- Draw/71 - Draw demo.red"
---- 

The `/multi` refinement of `request-file` allows multiple file selection, the results are returned as a block.

=== Reading from a file

---- 
== file: %README.md
>> read file
== {Red Programming Language^/------------------------^/^/**Red** is a new programming lan...
---- 

`read` takes an argument (`source`) of type `file!`, `url!` or `port!` and reads the contents of the source. If the source is a directory, `read` returns a block of elements of `file!` type.

---- 
>> red-master: %"/D/red-master/"
== %/D/red-master/
>> red-files: read red-master
== [%.appveyor.yml %.editorconfig %.gitattributes-sample %.github/ %.gitignore-sample %...
>> foreach file red-files[print [file "->" either dir? file["dir"]["file"]]]
.appveyor.yml -> file
.editorconfig -> file

=== Read/lines

If we are reading from a text file, it makes sense to be able to get the file content as separate lines. We can first read the file and split the string on `newline`. `read` provides a refinement `/lines` that splits the text on `newline` and thus returns a block of strings.

---- 
>> usage: read/lines %/D/red-master/usage.txt
== ["" "Usage: red [command] [options] [file]" "" {[file]: any Red or Red/System source...
>> length? usage
== 95
---- 

=== Reading binary files

When the file we want to read does not consist of ASCII characters, we need to read it as a binary file. We use the `/binary` refinement with `read`:


---- 
>> bin: read/binary %/D/red-master/usage.txt
== #{
0A55736167653A20726564205B636F6D6D616E645D205B6F7074696F6E735D20
5B66696C655D0A0A...
>> length? bin
== 4460
>> to string! copy/part bin 60
== {^/Usage: red [command] [options] [file]^/^/[file]: any Red or R}
---- 

You can start reading from specific position in a file with `/seek` refinement and limit the length of the content that is read with `/part`.

As you might have observed, in Red you donâ€™t need to open the file in advance and indicate the reading mode, as you do in Python:

---- 
>>> red_usage = open('D:/red-master/usage.txt', 'r')
>>> lines = red_usage.readlines()
>>> len(lines)
95
>>> lines[1]
'Usage: red [command] [options] [file]\n'
