Simple `sum` (and `average`) function added to Red.

Currently `sum` doesn't coalesce return value as `float!` in case of integer overflow. This could be done by a `safe` refinement with a cost of performance.

Here you can see a [comparison](https://gist.github.com/endo64/e0ea49bc2fb09d548bad1b077720eda5)

But we generally do not use that kind of error handling, and `add` doesn't have safety too.

Also note that `average` always returns `float!` value.

It could also be done by a HOF accumulator/fold approach.
