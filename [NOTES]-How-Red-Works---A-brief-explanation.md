# How Red Works - A brief explanation

_Posted to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18843544) by 9214_

Red (and Rebol) are based on research in denotational semantics that Carl Sassenrath did. I'll try to briefly explain the main points.

Everything starts with a UTF-8 encoded string. Each valid token in this string is converted to an internal data representation - a boxed structure, called a _value slot_ or sometimes a _cell_. Each value is represented as a boxed structure 4 machine pointers in size.

Value slot is composed of a _header_ and a _payload_. Header contains various flags and datatype ID, payload specifies exact content of the value. If content doesn't fit in one value slot, then payload contains a pointer to an external _buffer_ (an array of value slots, bytes, or other units + offset and start/end addresses IIRC) with extra data.

So, lexer converts string representation to a tree of value slots (this phase is called _loading_), which is essentially a concrete syntax tree (CST) - this is the crux of homoiconicity.

```red
>> "6 * 7"
== "6 * 7"
>> type? "6 * 7"
== string!
>> load "6 * 7"
== [6 * 7]
>> type? load "6 * 7"
== block!
>> first load "6 * 7"
== 6
>> type? first load "6 * 7"
== integer!
```

Everything is a (first-class) value, and every value has a datatype (we have roughly 50 of them right now). And there's no code - only this data structure, which is just a block, which you can freely manipulate at will (so as any other value).

```red
>> reverse [6 * 7]
== [7 * 6]
>> append reverse [6 * 7] [+ 1]
== [7 * 6 + 1]
>> skip append reverse [6 * 7] [+ 1] 2
== [6 + 1]
```

What interpreter does is just a "walk" over this tree of values, dictated by a set of simple evaluation rules (expressions are evaluated left to right, operators take precedence over functions and have a more tight left side, literals evaluate to themselves, functions are applied to a fixed set of arguments, symbolic values of type `set-word!` [more on this later] are bound to the result of expression that follows them, etc.) but there are a couple of catches.

The first catch is that some values are symbolic - that is, they indirectly refer to some other values via a _context_ (namespace). You can modify this reference (called _binding_) freely at runtime, and thus change the meaning of symbolic values and of an entire block that contains them.

So, the "meaning" of a given block is always relative to some context(s) - this is what _relative expression_ means (RE in REBOL). And context itself is just an environment of key/value pairs (key is a "symbol", value is its "meaning") represented as an object (O in REBOL).

```red
>> block: [6 * 7]             ; BLOCK: is a value of type SET-WORD!
== [6 * 7]
>> type? second block
== word!                      ; words are one of the symbolic values I've mentioned
>> do block
== 42
>> bind block object [*: :+]  ; now "multiplication" means "addition"
== [6 * 7]
>> do block
== 13
```

The second catch is that you are not restricted by default interpreter (represented by `do` function) and can use any other one or even implement your own, thus making an embedded DSL - a _dialect_ in Red/Rebol parlance.

* Red/System takes a block of C-level code and does the prescribed job.
* View takes a block that specifies GUI layout and shows a fancy window.
* Draw takes a block of drawing commands and renders an image.
* Parse takes an input series and a block of PEG grammar, and parses the input.
* Math takes a block and interprets it with common operator precedence rules.

Sky is the limit, and its dialects all the way down.

To reiterate: the basic building block (no pun intended) is a block of values, which can represent either code (relative expression which, upon evaluation, will yield a value) or data (just a bunch of values arranged in a specific format - such micro-formats are considered to be dialects too †). Block can also contain symbolic values (called words) which can change their binding during evaluation, and thus alter the semantics of expression.

There's a lot hiding behind the facade, as you can see. And what is there is hardly an ad-hoc hodge-podge slapped together.

(†): one example of such micro-format dialect is function specification, e.g.

```red
spec: [
  "Add two numeric values together"
  x [number!]
  y [number!]
]
```

is a specification (or an "interface") for a function that performs addition. Here's a block that expresses addition of two specific numbers:

```red
[1 + 2]
```

If we wish to abstract over it, we can substitute 1 and 2 for words:

```red
expression: [x + y]
```

And then we can alter bindings of these words to actual arguments we wish to add together:

```red
bind expression object [x: 1 y: 2]
```

We then can evaluate such expression and yield a resulting value:

```red
== do expression
>> 3
```

The trick is that functions are just abstraction over evaluation of expression in some environment, that is, a syntax sugar for

```red
do bind [...] object [...]
```

with some additional optimizations and type-checking. So, addition instead can be expressed as:

```red
>> add: func spec expression
== func [
"Add two numeric values together" 
x [number!] y [number!]
][x + y]

>> type? :add ; :ADD is a value of type GET-WORD! which, on evaluation, yields function's value referred by word ADD as-is, without triggering its application.
== function!
>> add 1 2
== 3
```

What `load` essentially does - it takes a string and returns a [concrete syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree) (or CST for short). `do` then takes that CST and evaluates it. You can do that in a single-step manner with `do/next` (there's also `load/next`). Moreso, you can think of blocks as phrase markers (see [wiki example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree)):

```
[S [NP John] [VP [V hit] [NP the [N ball]]]]
```

Now compare it to Red internal data structure written down in similar fashion:

```
<block! [<integer! 1> <word! +> <integer! 2>]>
```

Here I loosely follow phrase marker notation - nonterminals correspond to datatypes, terminals correspond to literal values. But datatype is implied by literal form, and implicitly contained in each value slot (its a datatype ID tag in the header), so I can tidy this up to:

```red
[1 + 2]
```

This is what lexer returns - just a block. You can then manipulate it whichever way you want and evaluate.
