AltME is excellent and offers a lot of features, but is dated and has aged a lot regarding UI and technology. There are a lot of tools and apps for (secure) communication, team-collaboration and other needs. The issue with these is, that they:

* are not secure
* don't offer end-to-end encryption
* do not provide everything out of the box (voice-communication, screen-sharing and more)
* are bloated (most are just Electron apps)
* resource hogs
* are not cross-platform
* need a smartphone to work on Desktop
* pricy
* complicated

The goal of AltME - Reloaded, and also OpenME, is to change this.

# Features needed

## Authentification and Encryption
Offering End-to-end encryption for everything from text-messaging to file-sharing to voice-communication is a must-have. This can be achieved with various algorithms.

### Details
* Perfect forward secrecy
* public-key cryptography
* OTP
* cryptographical hashes

### Algorithms/Technolgy used
* Salsa
* AES
* RSA
* SHA-256
* use hardware features like CPU extensions and hardware keys
* U2F/FIDO
* 2FA

## Compression
To keep the needed bandwidth small, applying compression is a must-have. Using state-of-the-art compression algorithms, compression is fast, reliable and cheap.

### Details
* compression is on by default/opt-out
* offer different compression algorithms in relation to the data

### Algorithms/Technolgy used

## P2P

## Text-Messaging
The most basic feature of communication is sending text messages.

## File-Sharing

## Screen-Sharing

## Crystal-Clear Voice-Chat

## Cross-Platform
