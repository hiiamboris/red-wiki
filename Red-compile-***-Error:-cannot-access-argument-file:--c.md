### Red compile *** Error: cannot access argument file:  -c
the error messages a few people over the years have seen and posted
it appears to be related to not being able to compile any programs with red.

please list details of the OS, commandline and how the red executable was obtained
maybe there will emerge a common denominator

#### OS version:
#### VM?:
#### user level access:
#### red version how and where obtained:
#### commandline and invoked from:


#### OS version:
 win7 pro 64
#### VM?:
 no
#### user level access.
 an admin account but I still have to run as admin quite a few things
#### if windows UAC:
 set to minimim but not off.
### red version how and where obtained. 
 built from source every month or less using rebol2
 I build them in the red-master source dir which is not on the path so I give the full path to run them
from another directory using something like total commander or cmd.exe or a short cut
#### commandline and invoked from: 
tried anything and everything. I can build the source/test/hello.red with rebol
but this doesn't seem to work with my programs even if I move them into the source dir


#### latest reference 
 17th of Feb 2018 on win10 and win7 or win8
