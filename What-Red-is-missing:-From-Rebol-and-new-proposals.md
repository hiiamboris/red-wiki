# Goals

- List things that are missing from Red, which exist in Rebol.
- Propose additional mezzanines or alternate functionality.
- Set up preliminary rules to select the final set of mezzanines to include.
- Make 3 categories:
  - Accepted (consensus or needed in the Red runtime)
  - Potential (to be discussed and weightened)
  - Rejected (too narrow use-case(s), too heavy, etc...).

# Preliminary Rules

- If something is rejected, we should note why, so we don't keep asking to include it. It also gives people a chance to fix proposals.


# Thoughts

It might be nice to note (maybe we need tags we can easily list for various purposes) *why* something was accepted. e.g., is it a common need? Does it exist in other languages and will help lure people? Does having it prevent arguments of "Red doesn't even have X"? Is it a great example others can use to learn from? For example, how do you write control funcs correctly at the mezz level, and what do you need to consider in doing so? Copying an existing one as a starting point can help a lot. Does it show off Red's power and flexibility? *--Gregg*
