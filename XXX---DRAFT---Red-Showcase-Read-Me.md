# Red/Showcase

This is a curated collection of apps which show both the breadth and depth of Red and its wide applicability. Every one is complete with no external dependencies. Each app is presented in a separate folder containing source files and instructions on how to run it.

If you have an app that you would like to contribute to the Red/Showcase, please follow the instructions at LINK.
