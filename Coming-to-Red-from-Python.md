## Why Red?

You might be wondering “Why I need to learn Red, when I have Python at hand?” Well, you probably don’t need to learn yet another programming language, but before you decide for yourself, consider the following:
-	Red is interpreted, but can be compiled. The resulting executable files are around 1MB, with no dependencies.
-	Red can be cross-compiled to different platforms (Windows, WindowsXP, Linux, Linux-ARM, RPi, Darwin,  macOS, Syllable, FreeBSD, Android, Android-x86).
-	Red has a fully reactive cross-platform native GUI system, with a UI Domain specific language (DSL) - View and drawing DSL – Draw.
-	Red has a powerful [PEG]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) parser DSL – Parse, that is highly readable and maintainable, unlike regex.
-	Red has an elegant and consistent syntax, allowing for easy learning. 
-	Red comes with a rich set of built-in datatypes (50+)
