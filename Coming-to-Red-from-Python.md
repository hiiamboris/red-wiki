## Why Red?

You might be wondering “Why I need to learn Red, when I have Python at hand?” Well, you probably don’t need to learn yet another programming language, but before you decide for yourself, consider the following:
-	Red is interpreted, but can be compiled. The resulting executable files are around 1MB, with no dependencies.
-	Red can be cross-compiled to different platforms (Windows, WindowsXP, Linux, Linux-ARM, RPi, Darwin,  macOS, Syllable, FreeBSD, Android, Android-x86).
-	Red has a fully reactive cross-platform native GUI system, with a UI Domain-specific language (DSL) - View and drawing DSL – Draw.
-	Red has a powerful [PEG]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) parser DSL – Parse, that is highly readable and maintainable, unlike regex.
-	[Red/system](https://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html) is a low level (think C) DSL, aimed at low-level system programming and higher performance. 
-	Red has an elegant and consistent syntax, allowing for easy learning. 
-	Red comes with a rich set of built-in [datatypes](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/datatypes.adoc) - more than 50.
-	All these make Red a full-stack language ("from metal to meta") that can be used for writing everything from drivers and operating systems, through applications, scripts, to Domain-specific languages and metaprogramming.

However, Red still doesn't have Python's rich ecosystem - for example we don't have any analogues of numpy/scipi. The module system is yet to be completed, as well as a set of higher order functions. At the moment of writing Red is 32 bit.

## Notes
### Thoughts for the 'why' section,
"Python is an amazing tool capable at almost every programming task imaginable, unless you have to deploy it. Oh, it can be done, no arguments there. But as soon as things get beyond "my linux box", the headaches grow exponentially. Eventually, we all just want to burn down the house. Perhaps Red can be your lighter."

"... At the moment of writing, Red is 32bit. But nothing in the python ecosystem is as powerful as parse, nor is python nearly as flexible. There is nothing like trying something for yourself though so lets dig in!"
