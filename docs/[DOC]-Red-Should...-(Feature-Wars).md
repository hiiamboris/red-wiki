People coming to Red from other languages often suggest that Red should adopt features from that language. The problem is that a language is not just a collection of features. You can't just drop new ones in and make the language better. You have to consider the language as a whole, its goals and aesthetics; its foundational principles and the conceptual integrity as viewed through different lenses. That doesn't mean Red can't adopt new features, just that it generally isn't quick and easy. Features make languages different, but that's not the same thing as making them better.

As language trends change, certain feature requests will come up again and again, repeatedly, over and over. To avoid endless chat that changes only slightly on each iteration, and to collect thoughts that explain Red's design choices better over time, this page contains some of these questions and requests, which we can point people to. More features are planned for Red and, yes, we even look at modern features.

If you really, adamantly, deeply feel that Red *must* have your feature-of-choice or it is doomed to failure, and its value isn't immediately clear to the team (who will respond by slapping their collective foreheads and raining down RED tokens upon you), the onus is on you to prove its worth and viability as an integral part of the language. The burden is *not* on Team Red, or its designer to justify why it shouldn't be added. 

That said, some new features will be great, and we all want to improve Red. So dig in, do your homework, defend your position, arm yourself with objective facts and hard numbers ("too slow" and "much faster" are not numbers, in case you were wondering), and make it impossible for us to refute your claims about objective benefit. Then, and this is the hard part, make it clear that you understand Red and show how your new feature dovetails beautifully into its design and architecture. That's how you win.
