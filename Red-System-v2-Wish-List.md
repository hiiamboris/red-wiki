This page lists all the features we would like to add to Red/System v2, which will be rewritten in Red. There are three sections; Included, Requested, Rejected.

## Included
These features will be incorporated into Red/System V2.

## Requested
These features have been requested for inclusion in Red/System V2.

1. Add support for string comparison to `=` operator. `=` would be a case-insensitive comparison, while `==`could be used for a case-sensitive one. See [issue #8] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/8).

2. The `=` and `==` operators should be used for almost-equal and strict-equal for float values.

3. stack-local struct values. See [issue #115] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/115). 

4. Allow type casting chaining. See [issue #132] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/132) and [issue #142] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/142).

5. Add a `break` keyword for early escaping from loops. See [issue #166] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/166).

6. Pointer to enum type name. See [issue #297] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/297).

7. Allow byte! as index. See [issue #318] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/318).

8. Replace #define pre-processor construct. The options are explained in [Pre-processor #define replacement](https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/wiki/Alternatives-to-Red-System-pre-processor-%23define).

9. Allow empty struct! definitions. See [issue #194] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/194).

## Rejected
These features will not be incorporated into Red/System V2.
