This page lists all the features we would like to add to Red/System v2, which will be rewritten in Red.

* Wish [#8](https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/8): add support for string comparison to `=` operator. `=` would be a case-insensitive comparison, while `==`could be used for a case-sensitive one. Same operators could also be used for almost-equal and strict-equal applied to float values.

* Wish [#115](https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/115): stack-local struct values.

* Wish [#132](https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/132) and [#142](https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/142): allow type casting chaining.

* Wish [#166](https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/166): add a `break` keyword for early escaping from loops.

* Wish [#297](https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/297): Pointer to enum type name
