This page lists all the features we would like to add to Red/System v2, which will be rewritten in Red.

* Wish #8: add support for string comparison to `=` operator. `=` would be a case-insensitive comparison, while `==`could be used for a case-sensitive one.

* Wish #115: stack-local struct values.

* Wish #132 and #142: allow type casting chaining.

* Issue #166: add a `break` keyword.
