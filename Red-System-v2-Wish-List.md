## Requested
These features have been requested for inclusion in Red/System V2.

2. The = and == operators should be used for almost-equal and strict-equal for float values.

3. stack-local struct values. (See https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/115) 

4. Allow type casting chaining. (See https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/132 and https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/142)

5. Add a `break` keyword for early escaping from loops. (See https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/166)

7. Allow byte! as index. (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/318)
