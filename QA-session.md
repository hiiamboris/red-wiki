### ICO
- Has a jurisdiction been chosen for the ICO?
- Let's say the ICO process brings in 10 000 000. How many additional developers do you estimate can Red hire to contribute in an efficient manner?

### RCT
- What are the transaction fees when RCTs are transferred between people and how are they paid?
- Does RTC have a good securities-law plan, or should US residents stay away?
- Isn't there a risk of a party, which has the most bying power, dictating the route of the project? Projects/features, users want to see to be released, can be supported/bought with these coins?

### /Core
- Is stuff like concurrency also required to reach 1.0, and be used on blockchains?
