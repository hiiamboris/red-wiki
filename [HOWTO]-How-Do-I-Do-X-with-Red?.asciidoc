__This is intended to be a collaborative list of how to perform common programming tasks with Red.__

### Use Help
'''
*Help Command*

* Display help about the help command `help`
The help command is a very powerful tool. Typing `help` at the repl will display information about all of the things help can do for you. Some really important callouts:
   - `help print` will display information about the `print` function.
   - `help "print"` will display all functions which have the string "print" in them, or their descriptions. Notice the `"`!
   - `?? print` will display the source code for the print function.

```red
>> help
        Use HELP or ? to view built-in docs for functions, values 
	for contexts, or all values of a given datatype:

		help append
		? system
		? function!

	To search for values by name, use a word:

		? pri
		? to-

	To also search in function specs, use a string:

		? "pri"
		? "issue!"

	Other useful functions:

		??     - Display a word and the value it references
		probe  - Print a molded value
		source - Show a function's source code
		what   - Show a list of known functions or words
		about  - Display version number and build date
		quit   - Leave the Red console
```

### Input and Output (IO)
'''

*Printing stuff*

* Print a value followed by a newline - `print`

```red
>> print "Hello Red"
Hello Red
```

```red
>> print ["2 x 2 =" 2 * 2]
2 x 2 = 4
```

* Print a word and the value it refers to - `??`

```red
>> n: 42
== 42

>> ?? n
n: 42
```

* Print something and return its value - `probe`

```red
>> probe n
42
== 42

```

*Reading stuff*

* Get console user input - `input`

```red
>> i: input   ; set i to the value returned from the input function

hi
== "hi"
```

```red
>> i
== "hi"
```

* Get console user input with a prompt -  `ask`

```red
>> i: ask "Who are you? "
Who are you? ME
== "ME"
```

* Read from a file, or url

```red 
>> read %day1.txt
== {1810^/1729^/1857^/1777^/1927^/1936^/1797^/1719^/1703^/1758^/1768^/2008^/1963^/1925^/1919^/...

### Graphics (VID and View)

* Create a Window (bare minimum) +

```red
view []
```

* Create a Window with a title and size constraints 

```red
view [title "HAL 9000" size 800x600]
```

Start with `VID` for easy graphics: https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/vid.adoc 

Move to the `View` for more power: https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/view.adoc

Have a look at `Draw` if you're into drawing things: https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/draw.adoc

'''

* A basic editor

```red
view/options/flags [
	title "Basic Editor"
	editor: area 800x600 on-change [face/parent/actors/saved?: no]
][
	menu: ["File" ["Open" open "Save" save "Quit" quit]] 
	actors: object [
		on-menu: func [face event][
			switch event/picked [
				open [open-file face] 
				save [save-file] 
				quit [check-saving]
			]
		]
		on-close: does [check-saving]
		on-resizing: func [face event][
			editor/size: face/size - 20
		]
		on-resize: func [face event][on-resizing face none]
		check-saving: does [unless saved? [confirm] unview] ; or `quit` but this kills console too
		saved?: yes 
		file: none 
		open-file: func [face][
			if file: request-file [
				editor/text: read file
				face/text: form file
			]
		]
		save-file: does [
			file: any [file "New"]
			if file: request-file/save/file file [
				write file editor/text 
				saved?: yes
			]
		]
		confirm: does [
			view [
				title "Confirm"
				text "Save file?" return 
				button "Yes" [save-file unview] 
				button "No" [unview]
			]
		]
	]
] 'resize
```

'''

### Strings

* Split a string - `split`
```red
>> split "abc,def,gh" #","
== ["abc" "def" "gh"]

>> split "Hello Red" space
== ["Hello" "Red"]
```

`help split` in the Red console

* Replace values in a string - `replace`

```red
>> s: "Red is fun?"
== "Red is fun?"

>> replace s "?" "!"

```

`help replace` in the Red console.


* Remove whitespace or other pesky characters - `trim`

```red
>> trim/all "one two three"
== "onetwothree"
