There are many ways to contribute to Red in addition to making [donations](http://www.red-lang.org/p/donations.html). This is a simple "how to" guide.

There are seven different ways to contribute to the Red project:
* Make fixes and enhancements to the Red and Red/System core and runtimes
* Write and maintain Red mezzanine functions, modules, objects and schemes   
* Write and maintain Red library functions
* Write and maintain Red/System library functions
* Write and maintain documentation and documentation systems
* Write and maintain Red and Red/System tests
* Use Red and Red/System and submit meaningful bug reports

No matter how small, you contribution will be valued and appreciated providing that you follow the guidelines.

## General Contribution Guidelines
1. You should be sure that you own the Intellectual Property Rights(IP) of any contribution you make to the Red project.
2. By submitting a contribution to the Red project, you are granting the Red project and, in particular, Nenad Rakocevic the right to publish your submission.
(A simple way for you to confirm both 1 & 2 will be introduced in due course.)
3. A lot of care and attention has been given to the design of both the Red and Red-System languages. Before starting work on anything to change or extend either language, please submit a proposal for your change by raising an issue on the Red project GitHub repository. (It could save you a lot of unnecessary work.)
4. All code submissions should include a reasonable set of tests written with [quick test](http://static.red-lang.org/red-system-quick-test.html).
