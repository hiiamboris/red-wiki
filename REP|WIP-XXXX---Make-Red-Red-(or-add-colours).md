## Summary

As of now, Red is not red. Red is white, red is black. Red is dull. Let's make Red Red. Let's make it colourful.

## Description

Currently, the whole of Red is black and white. Let's add more colour to the REPL as well to `red -h` as well as to `red c file.red` output, as well as to ... to make stuff visually distinguishable. For eg. `red -h` output can be made better by having the command line switches in different colour than its descriptions etc etc. Another example ![eg1](https://files.gitter.im/red/red/nB4y/blob).

## Use Case

The compiler/REPL checks if it is running in a TTY, if yes, then it runs itself in this colourful mode. 
For those who dislike colours, firstly -- shame on you, secondly -- the compiler/REPL should have a new compiler switch to turn off all the colours.

## Benefits

Different colours for different stuff, can make stuff visually distinguishable.

## Consequences

None that I can think of.

## Assistance

Wait patiently while someone implements the REP. :P
