Welcome, my friend! So you wanna learn red, huh? Well okay. I'm here.
But before we get really silly here, we have to make one simple rule.
You never put "red" with Capital "R" in the introduction. NEVER.
Got that? Good. My name is Brad. And THIS is LearnRed version 9001.
It is under the Creative Commons Attribution License currently.
Maybe GNU Free Document License in the future? I don't know.
Every program is allowed to have long introductions until we see
the words "red" or "red/System" with Capital "R" followed by [].
You know, square brackets, similar to round () or curly {}.

Red[]

; This is where you comment on a blank line

print "Hello friend." ; Hello fiend? That's lame

comment{
    Maybe i should give you a name, but that's a slippery slope.
    You're only in my head. We have to remember that. 
    S**t. I am talking to an imaginary person.
}

; Look at this! I am Elliot! Haha... but seriously, Mr. Robot is cool.
; Anyway, you can see now that we can comment as long as we have
; <== This symbol (called a semi-colon) or using "comment{" and "}".
; Remember, when you use curly, the comments need a tab space.
