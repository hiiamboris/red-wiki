# Purpose

What can we **achieve** by pursuing this undertaking?

1. A **strict definition** of each series-related function (**SRF**) in a common model, that gives us:

  1.1. An **overview** of the series situation, as a whole, that will become:

   1.1.1. A **learning material**, where one could see how things work in general.

   1.1.2. A foothold for **further SRF refinement**. Brain can only hold so much data in it's cache, and a convenient overlook of the model can lead to more improvements.

  1.2. A possibility to write an alternate, **high level, implementation** of all SRFs, that gives us:

   1.2.1. Means to **test**, when uncertain, every SRF against it's high level equivalent.

   1.2.2. We could write an **automatic test generation system** that would do tests for all SRFs with all refinement combinations and all edge cases (almost impossible to cover it all by hand).

  1.3. A basis on which spinoffs and **alternate implementations** of Red can be founded, and to which they should strive to conform.

 2. **Refinement** combination **compatibility** **matrices** (**RCCM**s) for each SRF, which will:

  2.1. Serve as a **reference** material and a hub of ideas behind every SRF implementation detail.

  2.2. Bring about all the current **quirks and oversights**, and may show us new uses for some combinations.

 3. Refinement **meaning consistency** enforcement, by finding and giving the outliers more appropriate names:

  3.1. This should enhance readability and improve language learning curve.


# The model

Note: the model only concerns series, and no other datatypes.

## Prelude

Let's say throughout the whole period of time Red program runs, we have M unique series in it. Each series has a head position and an associated buffer. We have K ≤ M unique buffers. Buffers are **mutable**: an operation on one series affects further operations on another series if they share a buffer. To reflect this mutability, we may describe a **state machine**: a state transition occurs when one of the buffers gets modified.

## Axiomatics

We have:
- M unique series, M is a nonnegative integer: M∊**Nₒ**
- K unique buffers, K is a nonnegative integer: K∊**Nₒ**

Because each series is associated with exactly one buffer, but each buffer can be associated with zero or more series, we have **K≤M**

A **buffer** B is an (infinite for simplicity!) sequence of values, defined on the integer set **Z**.

It maps an integer into a value:
∀i∊**Z**: B(i)∊**V**, where **V** is a set of all values that Red can possibly represent

Each series is associated with an index - an integer, which we will call "**offset**": Oₘ∊**Z**, 1≤m≤M

Each buffer is associated with **length**, or tail - a nonnegative integer: Nₖ∊**Nₒ**, 1≤k≤K

A buffer is called "empty" if it's associated length equals zero.

A **timeline**, from the program startup, up to it's current state, can be represented by a nonnegative integer instruction number t: t∊**Nₒ**.

**State** Aₜ of the program at time t≥0 consists of:
- K buffers: Bₖₜ(i), 1≤k≤K, Bₖₜ(i) is a function of integer
- K lengths: Nₖₜ, 1≤k≤K - size of usable data in k-th buffer Bₖ
- M buffer numbers: Kₘₜ, 1≤m≤M - associates k-th buffer Bₖ to m-th series Sₘ
- M offsets: Oₘₜ, 1≤m≤M

An **instruction** represents the transition of state Aₜ into next state Aₜ₊₁, during which only one of (Bₖₜ,Nₖₜ,Kₘₜ,Oₘₜ) can be changed.

The whole timeline A is a matrix of 4 columns: Bₖₜ(i),Nₖₜ,Kₘₜ,Oₘₜ, and T rows, where T is the count of instructions a program performs before termination.

At the time **t=0**:
- all buffers are "empty", meaning their lengths are set to zero:
Nₖₒ = 0, 1≤k≤K
- all series are "at their head", meaning their offsets are set to zero:
Oₘₒ = 0, 1≤m≤M

Series-to-buffer associations are currently constant:
Kₘₜ = Kₘₒ

For simplicity, each buffer and series **always exist**, they are never created or destroyed. Unused and not yet declared series/buffers are simply considered not being accessed.

When we need to "create" a new (temporary) m₁-th series, with a new k₁-th buffer, we just represent it as a magical choice of a series that isn't used anywhere else in the program and which buffer is not shared with any other series (∀m≠m₁: Kₘₜ≠k₁). Since we impose no upper limit on M, we're free to do so.

## State transitions

There are only three elementary state transitions through which all other modifying operations (save for `random` - it's nondeterministic) can be expressed:

1. `[rem m j]` **removes** j-th item from m-th series (affecting the buffer and all series that share it) by defining a buffer function Bₖₜ₊₁(i) and buffer length Nₖₜ₊₁ through the previous ones Bₖₜ(i) & Nₖₜ:
```
let k = Kₘₜ
Bₖₜ₊₁(i) =
	Bₖₜ(i),		if i < j
	Bₖₜ(i+1),	if i ≥ j
Nₖₜ₊₁ = Nₖₜ - 1
```
 Instruction is constrained: 0≤j&lt;Nₖₜ (otherwise is an error).

 j is an absolute zero-based index, independent of offset Oₘₜ.

2. `[ins m j x]` **inserts** item x into m-th series (affecting the buffer and all series that share it) by defining a buffer function Bₖₜ₊₁(i) and buffer length Nₖₜ₊₁ through the previous ones Bₖₜ(i) & Nₖₜ:
```
let k = Kₘₜ
Bₖₜ₊₁(i) =
	Bₖₜ(i),		if i < j
	Bₖₜ(i-1),	if i > j
	x,		if i = j
Nₖₜ₊₁ = Nₖₜ + 1
```
 Instruction is constrained: 0≤j≤Nₖₜ (otherwise is an error).

 j is an absolute zero-based index, independent of offset Oₘₜ.

3. `[ofs m j]` **shifts** the offset of m-th series by j:
```
Oₘₜ₊₁ = Oₘₜ + j
```

**Read-only** operations do not involve a state transition and are all done at the **same time t**.

Some specialty stuff (like `reduce` - it is not just about tossing items around) may require widening the basis.


## Mid-level definitions

These require definition through basic set of state transitions and access to (Bₖₜ(i),Nₖₜ,Kₘₜ,Oₘₜ) state.

Note: equality sign `=` henceforth is used as "identical" or "defined as", close to Red's `=?` (`same?`)

### Read-only functions

These do not change state.
Let's use `()` notation for them.

```
(index? m) =
	Oₘₜ + 1		;) 1-based
```
```
(pick m j) =
	Bₖₜ(j+Oₘₜ-1),	if (j > 0) and (1 ≤ j+Oₘₜ ≤ Nₖₜ)
	Bₖₜ(j+Oₘₜ),	if (j < 0) and (1 ≤ j+Oₘₜ ≤ Nₖₜ)
	none		otherwise (including j = 0)
where
	k = Kₘₜ
	none is a special value (none ∊ V)
```
```
(head m) =
	m₁		;) another series
where
	Kₘ₁ₜ = Kₘₜ,	;) of same buffer
	Oₘ₁ₜ = 0		;) and zero offset
```
```
(tail m) =
	m₁		;) another series
where
	Kₘ₁ₜ = Kₘₜ,	;) of same buffer
	Oₘ₁ₜ = Nₖₜ	;) and offset equal to tail
```
```
(skip m j) =
	m₁		;) another series
where
	Kₘ₁ₜ = Kₘₜ,	;) of same buffer
	Oₘ₁ₜ = j+Oₘₜ	;) and offset shifted by j
```
```
(copy m) =
	m₁			;) another series
where
	Kₘ₁ₜ = k₁,		;) of another buffer
	k₁ ≠ Kₘₜ ∀m≠m₁,		;) that is unique
	Oₘ₁ₜ = 0			;) offset set to zero
	Bₖ₁ₜ(i) = Bₖₜ(i+Oₘₜ)	;) contains identical data
```
```
(find m x) =
	(find* m x Oₘₜ)
where
	(find* m x o) =		;) helper func
		none,			if o ≥ Nₖₜ
		m₁,			if Bₖₜ(o) = x
		(find* m x o+1),	otherwise
	where
		k = Kₘₜ,
		Kₘ₁ₜ = k,	;) new series of same buffer
		Oₘ₁ₜ = o		;) at a new offset
```

The definition of `skip` above is applicable to free index model only (see below).
What we currently have is (see https://gitter.im/red/red?at=5da8508ef88b526fb95455ef):
```
(skip m j) =
	m₁
where
	Kₘ₁ₜ = Kₘₜ,
	Oₘ₁ₜ =
		j+Oₘₜ,	if 0 ≤ j+Oₘₜ ≤ Nₖₜ
		0,	if j+Oₘₜ < 0
		Nₖₜ,	if j+Oₘₜ > Nₖₜ
```

And so on... for all independent refinements and their interdependent combinations...


### Modifying functions

These *do* change state.
Let's use `[]` notation for them.

```
[clear m] =
	m,		if Oₘₜ ≥ Nₖₜ
	[clear* m]
where
	k = Kₘₜ,
	[clear* m]:
		[rem m Oₘₜ]
		= [clear m]
```

An advanced example PoC:
```
[change m₁ m₂] =
	m₁,	if O₂ₜ ≥ Nₖ₂ₜ		;) nothing in m₂
	[change* m₁ m₂ O₂ₜ]
where
	k₁ = Kₘ₁ₜ,
	k₂ = Kₘ₂ₜ,
	k₂ ≠ k₁,			;) simplified version - will only work properly on different buffers
	[change* m₁ m₂ o]:				;) helper func
		[ins m₁ O₁ₜ Bₖ₂ₜ(o)],	if (0 ≤ O₁ₜ ≤ Nₖ₁ₜ) and (0 ≤ o)
		[rem m₁ O₁ₜ+1],		if (0 < O₁ₜ+1 < Nₖ₁ₜ) and (0 ≤ o)
		[ofs m₁ 1],
		[change* m₁ m₂ o+1],	if o < Nₖ₂ₜ	;) until we reach m₂ tail
		= m₁					;) return m₁ after the last changed value
```
Note that the above `change` is defined even for negative offsets, it just does not perform a char substitution if Bₖ₂ₜ(o) is before it's head, e.g.:
```
m1: skip "abcde" -1
m2: skip "123" -2
;) .abcde
;)   +
;) ..123
;)   =
;) .a123e
;)  ^ a remains because it's "undefined" in m₂-th buffer (before the head)
;)      ^ e remains because it was after m₂-th tail
```
This brings sort of symmetry: items before the head and items after the tail are applied from m₂ to m₁ using the same rules.

And so on...

## High-level definitions

These can be expressed through other high level functions, without access to (Bₖₜ(i),Nₖₜ,Kₘₜ,Oₘₜ) state.

```
(back m) = (skip m -1)
```
```
(next m) = (skip m 1)
```
```
(at m j) =
	(skip m j-1),	if j > 0
	(skip m j),	if j ≤ 0
```
`at` can be constrained: j ≠ 0 (an error otherwise)
```
(offset? m1 m2) = (index? m2) - (index? m1)
```
```
(length? m) =
	0,	if (index? m) ≥ (index? tail m)
	(index? tail m) - (index? m)
```
```
(tail? m) =
	yes,	if (index? m) ≥ (index? tail m)
	no
```
```
(head? m) =
	yes,	if (index? m) ≤ (index? head m)
	no
```
Alternatively `head?` and `tail?` can check for index equality only.
```
(empty? m) =
	yes,	if (length? m) = 0
	no
```
```
(single? m) =
(last? m) =
	yes,	if (length? m) = 1
	no
```
```
(first m)  = (pick m 1)
(second m) = (pick m 2)
(third m)  = (pick m 3)
(fourth m) = (pick m 4)
(fifth m)  = (pick m 5)
```
```
(last m)   =
	none,	if (empty? m) = yes
	(pick tail m -1)
```

## Invariants

Note: this (and high-level definitions) is all **wishful thinking** right now and very few of these invariants/definitions hold in the current build.

### Free (unconstrained) index

An idea is to allow series' offset (`index?`) take **any integer** value.

R2 could internally work with pre-head and past-tail offsets but it was inconsistent about it:
```
>> index? #[block! [a] -2]		;) can construct a pre-head block
== -2					;) `index?` doesn't lie that offset is negative
>> index? b: #[block! [a] 10]
== 2
>> append b [1 2 3]
== [a 1 2 3]
>> index? b
== 2					;) so the constructed block was not past-tail
>> b: tail "1234567890"
== ""
>> clear head b				;) an R2 way to construct a past-tail block
== ""
>> index? b
== 11					;) works! and somehow it's not = 2! OMG!
>> c: b  repeat i 9 [append b i probe index? c]
2			;) observe:
3			;) I'm adding items to `b`
4			;) but it's `index? c` that changes every time
5			;) and initially it changed from 11 to 2 !!
6
7
8
9
10
== 10
```

In Red this is a different mess:
- **no** way to construct a **pre-head** block (except via R/S - but that will crash it for certain)
- when offset is past-tail, **`index? c` doesn't lie** about it - it will always report 11 in the previous snippet
- various functions deal with past-tail differently: https://gitter.im/red/red?at=5da8508ef88b526fb95455ef , `index? skip m 1` (positive skip) can be less than `index? m`, which is confusing.

But what if we didn't have any offset restriction? E.g. if m is at head, `skip m -1` would go ahead of it, and `index? m` would be -1, and so on. We would have:
- a lot **simpler** invariants (see the next section), that would not depend on data, and
- more **versatility** in series modifications, though we'll have to define SRFs behavior with negative offsets (see `change` definition above)

This may also ease our life if we will ever make a **`slice!`** datatype (kinda like series, but with controlled tail, not bound to the data size). If we will though, all /part refinements will become obsolete as we will be able to construct slices of `m` on the fly with `part m` function or something.

Please **speak your mind** in the discussion REP.

### Indexing consistency

```
(index? skip m j) = j + (index? m)			;) requires free index
```
```
(back next m) = (next back m) = (m)			;) requires free index
```
```
(skip skip m j -j) = (m)				;) requires free index
```
```
(index? head m) = 1
```
```
(index? tail m) ≥ (index? head m)			;) tail cannot precede head
```
```
(index? tail m) = (1 + length? head m)
```
```
(length? m) ≥ 0
```
```
(index? m) = (clear head m  index? m)			;) index? is not affected by tail
```

### /part symmetry

For functions supporting series & integer part (this especially affects `find` & `select`):
```
(func m1 /part m2) =
(func m2 /part m1) =
(func m1 /part offset? m1 m2) =
(func m2 /part offset? m2 m1)
```

For functions supporting only integer part (mold, form, read, write):
```
(func m1 /part j) = (func m1 /part 0)	if j < 0
```
Or alternatively negative /part for these can be an error.

### Ideal appending /into

```
(func ... /into m) = (append m func ...)		;) see #4109
```
```
(repend m x) = (append m reduce x)
```
Will this ever work for reduce/compose/repend when `m` contains code that modifies `m`?

### Other

```
(select m x) = (first find/tail m x),	when m is a series (x can be too)
```
When `m1` and `m2` are series (even if of the same buffer):
```
(change m1 m2) = (m3: copy m2  remove m1 /part length? m2  insert m1 m3)
(change m1 m2 /part p) = (m3: copy m2  remove m1 /part p  insert m1 m3)
```
See https://github.com/red/red/issues/4099 about this one:
```
(change m1 m2) = (change m1 copy m2)
```
Some `find` refinements:
```
(find/reverse m x) = (find/last m x /part head m)
(find/last m x) = (find/reverse tail m x /part m)

(find/tail m x) =
	(skip find m x length? x),	if x is a series
	(next find m x)			otherwise

(find/match m x) =
	(find/tail m x /part length? x),	if x is a series and no /only
	(find/tail m x /part 1)			otherwise
```

And so on...

# RCCM example

Here's one for `find` (notorious for being refinement-overloaded)
![](https://i.gyazo.com/3f0b28c6fb006238c29f116aa59101d6.png)

General principles:
- Define what refinements affect or conflict with one another
- Define if refinements expect narrower argument space, decide if it should be ignored or enforced (with an error), document it briefly
- Each cell, when it's not immediately obvious, should contain enough hints to replicate the reasoning behind it
