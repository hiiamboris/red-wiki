This page is where we can set expectations for parse performance, with simple and complex rules and varying types of data. We can also compare to other ways of processing and loading data when the full power of parse isn't needed. Showing how Red solutions compare to other languages will help people make informed decisions about when to use `parse` and what the alternatives are if you need maximum speed.
