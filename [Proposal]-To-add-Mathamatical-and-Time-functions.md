# Mathematics (for scientific calculators):
* Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
* Hyperbolic function: sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh
* Logarithms: log (for decimal), lg (for binary), lon (for duodecimal/dozenal), ln (for natural)
* Quotient and Modulo in multiple ways: Truncated, Floored, Eucliedian
* Modulo 1: FRACtion (fractional part), SAWtooth (y minus floor of y)
* Rounding: Ceiling, Floor, Truncate, Round Half up, Round Half down, Round half zero
* Factorial or n!=n*(n-1)! Permutation or P(n,r)=n!/(n-r)! Combination or C(n,r)=P(n,r)/r!

# Applied Mathematics (some basics for testing):
* [Cryptography and Error Correction]
* Error Correction: Extended Hamming, Extended Binary Golay and Reedâ€“Solomon
* Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme using GF256 (see https://github.com/hbs/PySSSS for example)
* 3DES, AES, serpent, blowfish and twofish in multiple modes of operation
* [Extra Curriculum Mathematics]
* Non-transitive Dice: Miwin's Dice, Efron's Dice, Grime's Dice, 3-Player Dice
* Shortest Unit Fraction Algorithm (see https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/numth/egypt/intro.html )
* [Lottery related Algorithms]
* Multicombination or multisubset or M(n,k)=C(n+k-1,k)
* Bernoulli trial (probability of k successes out on n) = C(n,k)*p^k*(1-p)^(n-k)
* Lotto(Ball,Pick,Win)=C(P,W)*C(B-P,P-W)/C(B,P)=(P!(B-P)!(P-W)!)^2/(W!B!(B-2P+W)!)
* co-lexicographic ordering of the combinations, for lottery tickets (see https://computationalcombinatorics.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/ranking-and-unranking-of-combinations-and-permutations/ )

# Time ("time unit reformation"):
* Traditional: 1 day is 24 hours, 1 hour is 4 quarters, 1 quarter is 15 minutes, 1 minute is 60 seconds
* Decimal: 1 day has 10 hours, 1 decimal hour has 100 minutes, 1 minute has 100 seconds
* Duodecimal/Dozenal: 1 day has 12 hours, 1 hour has 144 minutes, 1 minute has 144 seconds
* Hexadecimal: 1 day has 16 hours, 1 hour has 256 minutes, 1 minute has 256 seconds
* Old Chinese: 1 day is 12 shi, 1 shi is 5 dian, 1 dian is 10 ke, 1 ke is 10 fen, 1 fen is 10 hao
* New Earth: 1 day is 360 degrees, 1 degree is 60 minutes, 1 minute is 60 seconds

# Dates ("calendar reformation"):
* Date: Asimov, Hanke-Henry, Leap Week, Thirteen Month
* Days and months naming system: Positivist, Tranquility or French Republican

# Binary encoding (for transferring data through texts or phone calls):
* Binary to text (paper): binary, quaternary, octal, hexadecimal,  base32, base64, base85, base91
* Binary to mnemonic (phone): S/KEY, bubble babble, Pretty Good Privacy wordlist (a.k.a biometric word list) and Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 wordlist (a.k.a. BIP39 wordlist, Electrum 2 wordlist)

# Considering (will be removed if redundant):
Akan Calendar, Armenian Calendar, Aztec Calendar, Attic Calendar, Babylonian Calendar, Balinese Saka Calendar, Berber Calendar, Borana Calendar, Buddhist calendar, Burmese Calendar, Chinese Calendar, Chula Sakarat, Coligny Calendar, Coptic Calendar, Egyptian Calendar, Ethiopian Calendar, Gaelic Calendar, Hindu Calendar, Igbo Calendar, Iranian Calendar, Japanese Calendar, Javanese Calendar, Korean Calendar, Kurdish Calendar, Mayan Calendar, Mongolian Calendar, Pawukon Calendar, Rapa Nui Calendar, Soviet Calendar, Tabular Islamic Calendar, Tamil Calendar, Thai Calendar, Tibetan Calendar, Vira Nirvana Samvat, Yoruba Calendar, Zoroastrian Calendar, (Dreamspell), (Discordian)
* Criteria of calendar inclusion:
* Not a renamed version of Gregorian or Julian Calendar.
* All calendar system with the same properties shall be grouped together (e.g. all calendars with clustered 31 day months will be treated as the same calendar).
* Non-365 day calendars, calendars with non-Gregorian leap days and calendars with months more than 13 will not be excluded.
