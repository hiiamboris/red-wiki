# Mathematics (for scientific calculators):
* Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
* Hyperbolic function: sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh
* Logarithms: log (for decimal), lg (for binary), lon (for duodecimal/dozenal), ln (for natural)
* Quotient and Modulo in multiple ways: Truncated, Floored, Eucliedian
* Modulo 1: FRACtion (fractional part), SAWtooth (y minus floor of y)
* Rounding: Ceiling, Floor, Truncate, Round Half up, Round Half down, Round half zero
* Factorial or n!=n*(n-1)! Permutation or P(n,r)=n!/(n-r)! Combination or C(n,r)=P(n,r)/r!

# Applied Mathematics (some basics for testing):
* Error Correction: Extended Hamming, Extended Binary Golay and Reedâ€“Solomon
* Lotto(Ball,Pick,Win)=C(P,W)*C(B-P,P-W)/C(B,P)=(P!(B-P)!(P-W)!)^2/(W!B!(B-2P+W)!)
* Multicombination or multisubset or M(n,k)=C(n+k-1,k)
* Non-transitive Dice: Miwin's Dice, Efron's Dice, Grime's Dice, 3-Player Dice
* Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme using GF256 (see https://github.com/hbs/PySSSS as example)

# Time and date (for so called "unit/calendar reformation"):
* Time: decimal, duodecimal/dozenal, hexadecimal, sexagesimal, Chinese and "New Earth"
* Date: Asimov, Hanke-Henry, Leap Week, Thirteen Month
* Days and months naming system: Positivist, Tranquility or French Republican

# Binary encoding (for transferring data through texts or phone calls):
* Binary to text (paper): binary, quaternary, octal, hexadecimal,  base32, base64, base85, base91
* Binary to mnemonic (phone): S/KEY, bubble babble, Pretty Good Privacy wordlist (a.k.a biometric word list) and Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 wordlist (a.k.a. BIP39 wordlist, Electrum 2 wordlist)

# Considering (will be removed if redundant):
Akan Calendar, Armenian Calendar, Aztec Calendar, Attic Calendar, Babylonian Calendar, Balinese Saka Calendar, Berber Calendar, Borana Calendar, Buddhist calendar, Burmese Calendar, Chinese Calendar, Chula Sakarat, Coligny Calendar, Coptic Calendar, Egyptian Calendar, Ethiopian Calendar, Gaelic Calendar, Hindu Calendar, Igbo Calendar, Iranian Calendar, Japanese Calendar, Javanese Calendar, Korean Calendar, Kurdish Calendar, Mayan Calendar, Mongolian Calendar, Pawukon Calendar, Rapa Nui Calendar, Soviet Calendar, Tabular Islamic Calendar, Tamil Calendar, Thai Calendar, Tibetan Calendar, Vira Nirvana Samvat, Yoruba Calendar, Zoroastrian Calendar, (Dreamspell), (Discordian)
* Criteria of calendar inclusion:
* Not a renamed version of Gregorian or Julian Calendar.
* All calendar system with the same properties shall be grouped together (e.g. all calendars with clustered 31 day months will be treated as the same calendar).
* Non-365 day calendars, calendars with non-Gregorian leap days and calendars with months more than 13 will not be excluded.
