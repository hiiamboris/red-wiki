9, 1   Choice is better than no choice. The question of choice in case seems to me comparable to the choice in whether variables must be declared. Which is better in that case?  IMO, it comes down to preference and opinion and context (e.g., group standards; size of code; etc.).  If the programmer can't be trusted with the decision of case then maybe s/he also shouldn't be trusted to write a program to begin with?  If #9 (set in header) were enabled then the default (no specification in header) should be case matters.
