To give improved external interfacing capability and possible speed optimisations the following additional struct! features are requested:

* choice to align struct! members on suitable boundaries (eg 64-bit floats on 64-bit boundaries) [See issue #503] (https://github.com/dockimbel/Red/issues/503)
* bit fields
* unions
* arbitrary padding
