| </br> Red is a next-gen programming language, strongly inspired by REBOL. Red’s ambitious goal is to build the world’s first full-stack language, a language you can use from system programming tasks, up to high-level scripting through DSL. | Red has a fast growing, diverse, and friendly global community.</br> Have at look at our [communication values](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Community-Communication-Values), and then join the fun on Gitter chat or our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/red-lang). | Follow along with our short getting started guide.</br> If you prefer, you can go directly to our [downloads](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) page. | Our official documentation for Red and Red/System.</br> You can also read our [readme](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/README.md), check out the custom sidebar in the Wiki, or read some [source](https://github.com/red/red) code at our official github repository.</br>
