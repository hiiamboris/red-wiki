# Red/Code

This repository contains code written in Red and its dialects by the Red community. There are four sections in the repository, Scripts, ShowCase, Library and Faces. This repository is curated in the sense that contributions are included when they meet the applicable criteria.

## Scripts

This section of the repository contains short scripts which demonstrate both a feature of Red and its expressiveness. These scripts can be run from the Red console. The Scripts section has a number of sub-sections: Cross-Platform CLI, Cross-Platform GUI, Windows, Linux, OS X, Android and iOS.

## Showcase

This is a collection of apps which show both the breadth and depth of Red and its wide applicability. Every one is complete with no external dependencies. Each app is presented in a separate folder containing source files and instructions on how to run it.

## Library

This is a collection of useful Library functions and modules that can be included in Red programs. Its two sub-sections are Red and Red/System. All library functions and modules have API documentation.

## Faces

This is a collection of additional [Red/View faces](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Red-View-Graphic-System) that can be incorporated in Red/View programs. It has a number of sub-sections: Cross-Platform, Windows, Linux, OS X, Android and iOS.
