When starting with a new language, there will be new things to learn, and things you expect to work the way you're used to, but don't. 

# Words evaluate by default

```Red
>> 'a
== a
>> a
*** Script Error: a has no value
*** Where: catch
>> :a
>> a:
*** Script Error: a: needs a value
*** Where: a
>> type? :a
== unset!
```
# Words are evaluated before they are passed to a function.
For example: `value? bflmpsv` will throw an error, because bflmpsvz gets evaluated and the result of the evaluation is passed to `value?`
```Red
>> value? bflmpsv
*** Script Error: bflmpsv has no value
*** Where: value?
*** Stack:
```

Check for unset! with `get/any`:
```Red
>> type? get/any 'bflmpsvz
== unset!
```
If you want to catch general "no value" errors, use `attempt`:
```Red
>> attempt [value? sdfdfsfg]
== none
```

# Only `false` and `none` are falsey

Everything else, 0, empty strings, etc. is truthy. In addition, `to` and `make` don't have the same semantics when creating logic values. e.g.:

```Red
>> to logic! 0
== true
>> make logic! 0
== false
```

# `Return:` typeset is `any-type!`, not `default!`

`Default!` doesn't include `unset!`.

# Series types should usually be copied inside functions

Otherwise your function may behave differently on each call. See the topic: [[Why you have to copy series values]]

# What're the differences between `as` and `to`

`To` and `as` are both _type-adapting_ functions, but with different behavior. The difference may seem subtle, but is very important. `To` creates a new value, copying the underlying buffers if any. `As` just coerces a series type to another compatible type in the same type class, and underlying buffers are shared. `To` is defined for almost all types, while `as` is only defined for `any-string!` and `any-block!` type classes (except `hash!`). You can see the difference in the following example.

```
>> s: "abc"
== "abc"
>> f: to file! s
== %abc
>> append s #"d"
== "abcd"
>> f
== %abc


>> s: "abc"
== "abc"
>> f: as file! s
== %abc
>> append s #"d"
== "abcd"
>> f
== %abcd

>> remove f
== %bcd
>> s
== "bcd"

```

# Macros in Red vs Red/System

This may seem an advanced topic for a primer, but so many new Reducers (Red Users) jump right in and start using these features, that it's worth mentioning here.

Red and Red/System (R/S) use two different preprocessors which have little in common, as they live in very different abstraction layers. "Macros" in Red are Lisp-like, while in R/S, they are C-like. `#define` is the name used because of its meaning in C, the behavior, and the fact that R/S is a C-level language. While it might seem like using `#macro` as the name in R/S would help, to match Red, it would probably create confusion, as R/S macros have little in common with those in Red. R/S macros are optionally parametrized templates, while Red macros are functions.

Although lexically and syntactically, R/S is a dialect of Red, you need to remember that they are two very different languages semantically.
