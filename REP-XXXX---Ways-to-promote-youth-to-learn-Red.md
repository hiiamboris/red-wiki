_This is a public proposal, everyone is allowed to add suggestion to this_

# Creating a simplified dialect
* "Lego Bricks" Graphical Programming that has the design of Scratch
* Creating a red dialect for absolute programming beginners
    * Think "Learn Red in Minutes" but easier to use
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_educational_programming_languages
* using https://www.pythontutor.com/ as an example
    * Allows step-by-step analysis on the code with diagram GUIs
* using https://clojurekoans.com/ as an example
    * Create a series of "koans" to gently lead a new user to red mastery via TDD.

# Easy to access online interpreter and learning
* https://repl.it/ like websites
    * Allows terminal/command-line and IDE/text-editor on split screen
    * Syntax-highlighting help kids to identify code and errors
    * Code Assistance and Context Completion makes typing fast
        * Code Assistance provides a list of plausible terms
        * Context Completion uses existing training data sets
    * Spell-checking helps kids with bad spelling skills to code
    * Debuggers to show the exact line of error
* using https://www.codecademy.com/ as an example
    * Allows a 1-to-1 like tutorial
    * Automatically records progress on the cloud or offline
        * Might require a big server to store the data
        * If it is stored in the client, would it expand uncontrollably?
* using a simplified versions of the the Git system
* for young non-English native speakers, make a translation of Red words to the native language
    * first, the child gets the logic of programming; he codes in Fred (French Red), Chred (Chinese Red), Spred (Spanish Red), etc.
    * then, he is shown the *real* Red words,
    * once he knows/understands English, he can code in regular Red code, he can even keeps on mixing his native language with normal Red as he learns English.


# Real-life correspondence
* Collaborate RaspberryPi and its clones
    * Collaborate with [Pi Top](https://www.pi-top.com/)
    * Put focus on RaspberryPi's official languages
        * Python, Ruby, Perl, Squeak-Smalltalk
        * C, C++, Java, BBC BASIC
* Collaboration with LittleBits and other similar projects
    * [BeagleBone](http://beagleboard.org/)
    * [LittleBits](https://littlebits.cc/)
    * [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

# Creating promotional works and campaigns to pitch Red
* create a cultural distinction between Red and other languages
    * e.g. "Redder and Hotter than Ruby"
* using "Edginess" (want to challenge authority) as selling point
    * e.g. "We are the ProGrammer Nazi"
* using Augmented Reality Games to gain mythical/fictional narrative
    * e.g. ...
* writing articles in magazines, this method proved to be effective, at least in France, to spread the Rebol word, a while ago
    * e.g. copy+paste all Olivier Auverlot's articles, substituting Rebol with Red (of course with Olivier's approval, or even better, participation)
