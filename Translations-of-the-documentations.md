# **WORK IN PROGRESS**

## General workflow:
1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/red/docs/).

1. `git commit` + `git push` to your fork 
1. Click to create a Pull Request.

**Important**: Make sure your local docs are up to date first by pulling from the original repository.

- create a new directory with your [language code](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm) (for the first translator in a given language) - the directory should contain only translations
