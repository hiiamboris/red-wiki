# What do `#system` and `#system-global` do, when used in Red?

`#system` includes the argument block of Red/System code at current position in the generated R/S source code resulting from Red code compilation. `#system-global` works similarly, but places the argument code in the global space, outside of the Red runtime and user code contexts. Normally, you use routines to interface Red and R/S code, though those directives can come (handy)[https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/environment/system.red#L359] in (some)[https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/libRed/libRed.red#L16] special (cases)[https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/environment/functions.red#L914].
