## Introduction
There are a number of issues in using Unicode text encoding. This page gives a brief overview of the issues and the proposed resolution in Red.

## Encoding Normalisation
Many printable characters can be encoded in more than one way in Unicode. They may be encoded in a single code point (generally called a precomposed character) or a sequence of code points (decomposed) For example, whilst in ISO 8859-1 the letter 'ç' can only be represented as the single character E7 'ç', but in a Unicode encoding it can be represented as the single code point U+00E7 'ç' or the sequence U+0063 'c' U+0327 '¸'. A fuller understanding of the issue may be gained by reading this [Unicode.org technical report](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/) and this [W3C paper](http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod-norm/) .
