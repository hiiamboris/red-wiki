# Rooms suggestions
Gitter favors rooms based on github repos. We could re-organize code according to

## Audience based
1. Beginners to redbol `welcome`, also could be *learn*, *hello (world)*, only intro (no large code here, more Q&A, point to docs and SO)
2. Re(d)bol users `help`, also could be *code-help*, *code-review* (any question should have at least partially working code here, or snippets. Link to SO code review)
3. Redsystem users `red/system`?
4. Red-development `red/red` (design vs regressions?)
5. Red code snippets, libraries, demos, etc. `mezz`, also could be *code(-snippets)*, *pastebin*
6. Language based, e.g. `Chinese`
?? Red for programmers of X ( we have  `lisp`, why not others)? altho, I think we should have paradigms instead of languages: *functional*, *object-oriented*, *logic*, *ML*

## Topic based
1. +Dialects and parse. `dialecting`
2. ++Metaprogramming `lisp` room sometimes has discussions a bit like this
3. VID `red-guibranch`?
4. +Draw
5. +Red concepts `concepts` semantics, syntactically invisible things like *context*, theory, etc
6. Tests `tests`? currently dedicated to quicktest and tests in red system
7. Random `sandbox`
8. Bugs.. `bugs` regressions/design vs other ?
9. Data types and formats, currently we have lots of these `RIF`, `vector-datatype`, etc
?? more of these? 
?Programming paradigms? Integrations and ffi, data formats, api, parsers, editors and IDE, math, scientific programming, opencv and visual media

## Repo based
1. Red `red/red`
2. Code `red/code`, could be `samples` or `examples` to avoid confusion with a room to
3. Red official docs `red/doc` need a separate topical room on other docs, documentation style guides, etc.. 

Note: `+` is room suggestions
What I don't know is how to gently enforce rules. Maybe a bot?
