Have you just started your Red adventure and got a lot of questions? Check some of the frequently asked questions and answers below:

# I need help, what should I do?
Developing a problem-solving mindset is a core skill in becoming a good programmer, so keeping that in mind, try to find the answer you are looking for  following these 7 fail-proof steps:

1. Red's console `help` command is your personal helper! 
Type `help` in the Red console to learn how access the built-in documentation. Don't be afraid, Red's internal documentation is very concise so you can get grasp the main information in a glance. Try typing `help help` to see how `help` itself operates.

2. [Red By Example](https://www.red-by-example.org/) - Here you will find a library of usage examples that hopefully will shed some light on what you are trying to accomplish.

3. [Red Official Documentation](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/SUMMARY.adoc) -  It's currently under construction, but you may find what you are looking for there.

4. Rebol Docs, specially [Rebol/Core Manual](http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore.html) - Red has a lot in common with its older Rebol brother.  

5. Red Wiki -> 

6. Search "redlang + your-question" in your favorite web search engine 

7. Ask us, we are here to help!

# 3. I have been looking at the Rebol Docs a lot, but not everything works in Red, why?
While both languages share similar look'n'feel, Red is not entirely compatible with Rebol and is not developed with that goal in mind; it tries to take the best parts from both Rebol2 and Rebol3, bringing its own design novelty when needed.

As Red user manual is not quite finished yet, [REBOL/Core manual](http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore.html) is usually recommended as newcomer's starting point; one can read it with [this](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-REBOL-Core-Users-Guide-__-A-walkthrough-with-Red) walkthrough at hand and then progress thru a [list](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BLINKS%5D-Learning-resources) of other learning resources if deemed necessary.
