Have you just started your Red adventure and got a lot of questions? Check some of the frequently asked questions and answers below:

# 1. I have been looking at the Rebol Docs a lot, but not everything works in Red, why?
While both languages share similar look'n'feel, Red is not entirely compatible with Rebol and is not developed with that goal in mind; it tries to take the best parts from both Rebol2 and Rebol3, bringing its own design novelty when needed.

As Red user manual is not quite finished yet, [REBOL/Core manual](http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore.html) is usually recommended as newcomer's starting point; one can read it with [this](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-REBOL-Core-Users-Guide-__-A-walkthrough-with-Red) walkthrough at hand and then progress thru a [list](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BLINKS%5D-Learning-resources) of other learning resources if deemed necessary.

For a non-exhaustive list of differences between Rebol and Red, check out [this](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Differences-between-Red-and-Rebol) wiki page.
