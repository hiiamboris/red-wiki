`Sort` is a powerful and flexible function in Red, giving you control over sort stability, case sensitivity, partial sorting of series, what is compared when sorting compound values, and defining a custom comparator.

# Datatype sorting

Just as spreadsheets sort by the 3 types they understand (number, string, and boolean), Red does the same thing, except it does it for every datatype *it* understands. Within a given type, values sort as you expect.

`EXAMPLE TBD`

# Pairs

Pairs sort first by their `y` value, then their `x` value.
